# Natural Language SQL Query Generator

A web-based application that enables users to interact with a SQLite database using natural language queries through Google‚Äôs Gemini language model. This app translates English questions into SQL queries, making it easy to retrieve database information without needing SQL knowledge.

## üöÄ Features

* **Natural Language to SQL Conversion**: Converts user questions in English into SQL queries using Google Gemini.
* **Database Interaction**: Executes SQL queries on a SQLite database and retrieves relevant data.
* **AI-Powered Query Generation**: Utilizes Google Generative AI for natural language processing to interpret user questions.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and interactive user experience.
* **Dynamic Query Results**: Displays query results from the database directly in the app interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python**: Core programming language used for development.
* **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web-based interface.
* **Google Generative AI**: Powers the natural language to SQL conversion.
* **SQLite3**: Database used to store and retrieve student data.
* **dotenv**: For securely loading environment variables.
